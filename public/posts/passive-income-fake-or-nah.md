# Is Passive Income Fake... or Nah?

Some people say it’s a scam. Others say it changed their life.

Here’s the truth:

## ✅ What Passive Income *Really* Means

It’s not magic. It’s **systems that make money without your active time**, like:

- Automated digital products (courses, PDFs)
- Stock or crypto investments (DCA into BTC/ETH)
- Real estate (but with management tools or VAs)

## ❌ Why People Think It's Fake

- They expect money **instantly**
- They quit before the flywheel spins
- They confuse *easy* with *effortless*

## 💡 Real Passive Income = Frontloaded Systems

You build once, then **get paid forever**. Rav Growth helps you do exactly that.
